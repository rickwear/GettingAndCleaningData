#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Repo for the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

##Project Overview

This project requires the student to carry out processing of a set of data with the intent of generating a tidy, clean data set that can be used in future analysis. 

A full description of the data used in this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Running The Script

Before you run_analysis.R you will need to set the path of the working directory to your local parent directory containing the _UCI HAR Dataset_ directory on your system.

##Project Information

The project outline supplied was:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information

More detailled information regarding the operation of the code, the data attributes and the transformations are included in the associated CodeBook.MD file.
